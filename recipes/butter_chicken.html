        <h1><strong>Simple Butter chicken Recipe</strong></h1>
        <p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes. It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well.
        <p> It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne. Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.</p>

            <h3><strong>Instructions</strong></h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Mixture:</strong>In a large mixing bowl, combine the minced meat, chopped onion, minced garlic, ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, salt, pepper, and chopped parsley or coriander (if using). Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed throughout the meat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shape the Kebabs:</strong></li>
                    <li><strong></strong>Once the mixture is well combined, take small portions of the mixture and shape them into long, sausage-like shapes, about 10-12 cm long and 2-3 cm thick. You can use your hands or a skewer to shape them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Preheat the Grill or Barbecue:</strong>Preheat your grill or barbecue to medium-high heat. If you're using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 30 minutes beforehand to prevent them from burning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thread the Meat onto Skewers:</strong>Thread the meat mixture onto the skewers, leaving a little space between each piece to ensure even cooking.</li>
                    <li><strong>Brush with Olive Oil:</strong>Brush the kebabs with olive oil to prevent them from sticking to the grill and to help them brown nicely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Grill the Kebabs:</strong>Place the kebabs on the preheated grill or barbecue and cook for about 8-10 minutes, turning them occasionally, until they are cooked through and nicely browned on all sides.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rest Before Serving:</strong>Once the kebabs are cooked, remove them from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes before serving.</li>
                    <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy:</strong>Serve the kebabs hot, with your choice of accompaniments such as pita bread, rice, salad, and yogurt sauce.</li>
