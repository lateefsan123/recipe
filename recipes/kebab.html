    <h3><strong>Description</strong></h3>
        <p>Doner kebab also spelled as döner kebab, is a dish of Turkish origin made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie.</p>
        <p>Kebabs consist of cut up or ground meat, sometimes with vegetables and various other accompaniments according to the specific recipe. Although kebabs are typically cooked on a skewer over a fire, some kebab dishes are oven-baked in a pan, or prepared as a stew such as tas kebab.</p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g lamb mince</li>
            <li>1 small onion, coarsely grated</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, minced or finely grated</li>
            <li>100g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground coriander</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>¼ tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>sunflower oil for oiling</li>
        </ul>
    <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Tip all the ingredients except the oil into a food processor with a large pinch of salt and lots of ground pepper. Pulse until everything is combined and chopped together. You can also just squish everything together in a bowl but this will give you a looser finish.</li>
            <li>Oil a large sheet of foil, tip the meat mix in the middle and mould to a very thick sausage, roughly the shape of an aubergine. Roll up the foil tightly, twisting up the ends to create a Christmas cracker shape.</li>
            <li>Lay on a shallow roasting tin and roast in the oven for 35-40 mins, turning occasionally, or until a digital cooking thermometer reads 75C when pierced in the middle. Leave the kebab to cool a little, then unwrap the foil. Place back on the tray and brown under the grill or with a blowtorch.</li>
            <li>Place on a board and carve into thin slices. For full doner mode, you can hold the kebab up with a roasting fork or metal skewer and carve. Serve with warm pitta bread and any of the other accompaniments, including our chilli sauce and garlic yogurt sauce.</li>
        </ol>
